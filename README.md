# Geographical-distribution-of-Covid-19-in-various-regions-around-the-world.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
  <br>

The background of this project was derived from a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets where an analysis was done on the Geographical distribution of Covid-19 in various regions around the world.
This analysis was done to find out the regions of the world with most Covid=19 cases and related deaths in the year 2020, as to proffer solutions in the prevention vaccination and treatment of covid-19 patients globally
This analysis so basically this analysis is been done to have a cursory gaze on the prevalence of the pandemic in various parts of the globe.


<b>DESIGN</b>
  <br>
Steps which have been taking to clean the data include the following:
  <br>
  <li> Downloading and merging data from Covid-19 Global distribution dataset from Kaggle</li>
  <li> Removing of Duplicate data </li>
  <li>Find and replace incomplete data </li>
  <li>Using the IF function to determine the number of countries in Asia and those not in Asia </li>
<li> Using the VLOOKUP to remove Duplicate countries and to have a separate sheet showing more clearly the dates, the number of cases, the number of deaths and the Cumulative_number_for_14_days_of_COVID-19_cases_per_100000 </li>
  
 <n FINDINGS
Tables from Excel
Because of the size of the Dataset on google shoots, I am unable to attach a screenshot

  <b>FINDINGS</b>
  <br>
Taking a cursory look from our pie chart below, we can see continents with the high and lowest death rates
  <li> 2. Europe has the highest death rates followed by Asia and America </li>
  <li> 3. Africa and Oceania both have the least death rates.</li>
  <li>4. Oceania has the least death rate amongst all</li>

  <b>Analysis</b>
  <br>
<li> 10 out of 12 months America had the highest number of covid19 cases worldwide and the total number of deaths recorded globally</li>
  <li> The highest cases are found in America, followed by the Europe, Asia , Africa then Oceania</li>
  <li>  Oceania a continent had the lowest number of Deaths globally</li>
  <li> From my VLOOKUP highest number of cases were found in United State, India and Brazil </li>
<li> With the results gotten vaccination campaigns should be more focused the regions highest hit by the pandemic.</li>
  <br>
  <b>Conclusion</b>
  <br>
From the results obtained, more priority in terms of covid19 vaccinations should be given
